## 📖 Overview
Vibemarketingflow provides a set of n8n workflow exports designed to streamline your marketing content pipeline. This tool helps you gather knowledge about your entity, create messaging foundations, and automatically generate and schedule content. 

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with vibemarketingflow, follow the steps below to download and run the software.

### 1. Visit the Releases Page
Go to our [Releases page](https://github.com/yedoww/vibemarketingflow/releases) to find the latest version of vibemarketingflow.

### 2. Choose Your Files
You will see several JSON files available for download:

- **OverallFlow.json**: This master orchestration builds an entity profile from start to finish, including Persona, Core Messages, Target Audiences, Communication Style, Adjectives, and Example Messages. It writes results to Airtable using multiple "Create a record" nodes. It also utilizes OpenRouter LLM and Perplexity to enhance content generation.

- **KnowledgeSetting.json**: This file helps with knowledge ingestion. It scrapes a target website using ScrapeNinja, defines "WebsiteInfo", and derives various components like Persona and Core Messages. This is useful for refreshing your entity record in Airtable and includes an Airtable trigger.

- **DailyFlow.json**: This file focuses on daily long-form content creation, like blogs. It generates prompts based on the entity profile you have set up.
